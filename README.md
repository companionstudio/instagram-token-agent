# Instagram Token Agent

## A service to keep your Instagram Basic Display API token fresh.

⚠️**Fresh, beta software! Please raise any issues with deployment and use [here](https://github.com/companionstudio/instagram-token-agent/issues).**

This agent is designed to run as a small, self-contained app on [Heroku](https://heroku.com) (though there are other ways to run it if you prefer). By default, it **runs using free services** and will keep your token up to date once set up correctly.

This agent is designed to work with libraries like [instafeed.js](https://github.com/stevenschobert/instafeed.js) which need a valid token to operate. These tokens need to be periodically refreshed - **Instagram Token Agent** takes care of that for you.

## You will need

To begin, you'll need the following:

 - A Facebook Developer account
 - An Instagram account
 - A Verified Heroku account (Verification uses a credit card, though running the Token Agent will not cost you anything.)

## Setting up:

**1.** [Follow steps 1 - 3 here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/getting-started) to create an application on Facebook to connect to Instagram.

**2.** Use the [User Token Generator](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/overview#user-token-generator) to create a starting access token. Copy this token and keep it handy for the next step.

**3.** Click this handy 'Deploy' button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

**4.** On the page that follows, fill in the following values:

![heroku-deploy-config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53896/77387614-cc3d7080-6ddd-11ea-800a-30ec986eedd9.png)

 - **App name**: Make up a name for your app - it needs to be unique, like a username. Something like `your-name-token-agent` will do.

_Under 'Config vars'_:

- **App name**: Copy+paste your app name here as well.
- **Starting Token**: Paste your initial token from Facebook here.

Everything else can be left as default.

**5.** Click _Deploy App_.

The deployment process can take a minute or so. Once complete, you'll see a _View_ button to visit your new application. The following setup pages include instructions on how to use your new tokens.

**6.** Configure Heroku Scheduler

 Once the app is deployed,
 - go to your app Heroku dashboard and open the Heroku Scheduler add-on
 - _Add Job__ with Run Command defined to `rake refresh` scheduled everyday
 - Then __Save Job__

## Using the token in your site:

The instructions in your new token agent app will provide you with two simple ways to access your token value from your site:

* **JS Snippet:** Just include the `<script>` tag in your page, before any code that need to use the token, and you'll have access to a global constant called `InstagramToken` by default. If you'd like your constant named something else, add `?const=SomeOtherName` to the script's address.

* **JSON Object:** If you'd like a JSON object instead, call `/token.json` - you'll get an object with a single key `token`, with the value of your token.

[Check out a demo](https://codepen.io/companionstudio/pen/xxGyVKN) of these access methods.

## Configuration options

Instagram Token Agent is designed to be configured using Heroku's web UI or CLI. It understands the following environment variables:

| Key  | Description  | Default  |
|---|---|---|
| `HIDE_HELP_PAGES` | Set to `true` to turn off the setup pages that aren't needed in production.  | none (Help pages display by default) |
| `ALLOWED_DOMAINS`  | White-list of the domains that can request the token via JS snippet or JSON object | Your app's own herokuapp.com domain  |
| `REFRESH_MODE`  | How should the refresh schedule work? Currently, only 'cron' is allowed, which refreshes on a set schedule | `cron`  |
| `REFRESH_FREQUENCY`  | How often should we refresh the token? Currently 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly' are supported.  | `weekly`  |
| `JS_CONSTANT_NAME` | Set the name of the constant provided by the JS snippet  | `InstagramToken` |

To set these options in the Heroku dashboard, click the 'Settings' tab in your app, then _Reveal Config Vars_.  

## API Rate limits

~~By default, apps using the Instagram Basic Display API are limited to 200 requests per hour, but there's a (relatively simple way to extend that](https://github.com/companionstudio/instagram-token-agent/wiki/Instagram-API-Limits).~~

Basic Display API integrations have a per-user request limit which is unpublished and currently can't be extended.

## What are all the moving parts?

This app is designed to run using free plans and add-ons at Heroku, and be configurable via Heroku's interface, so you don't need to use the [CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) if you don't want to.

Here are the main parts and what they do:

 - **Heroku free dyno:** This serves the requests for tokens. Free dynos are limited in the amount of work they can do per month, but this should be ample for most sites just serving tokens.
 - **Heroku Scheduler:** This service schedules the app to refresh the token with Instagram to keep it working.
 - **Heroku Postgres:** The database that stores the token value
 - **MemCachier:** This caches the token payloads the agent sends out to keep things fast and take load off of the free dynos.

## Privacy considerations

Each installation of the agent is independent and self-contained. There's no 'phoning-home' or any other sending of data from your app to [Companion Studio]() or anyone else.

## To do

This is a first cut of this application, and there are still a lot of things to be done:

 - Add tests (!)
 - Improve documentation and setup instructions
 - Investigate a simpler scheduling/refresh solution
 - Work out a nice way to trigger the refresh tasks within the app or in heroku
 - ~~Add a switch to turn the 'hello world' pages off in production~~
 - ~~Make the domain whitelist actually do something~~
 - Add some mechanism whereby updating the starting token restarts the process
